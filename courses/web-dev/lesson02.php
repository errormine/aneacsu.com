                        HTML pages can be edited using even the most basic text editor, however, it is recommended to use something a little more powerful to save you some headache.

                    <p>
                        There are simple text editors such as Notepad which comes with Windows.

                    <p>
                        You can use whatever you would like and I will go over how to download and install all of these below.

                    <p>
                        Notepad ++ is a basic Text Editor, however, it has more features than Notepad and is a great choice for beginners who do not want to get distracted by extra features.

                        Atom is my preferred choice for text editor as it is lightweight, free and open-source, and available on all platforms.

                        Visual Studio Code is another option with a massive amount of features great for advanced users. If you are unsure I recommend you stick with a more basic editor.

                        Notepad comes installed with Windows and can be opened from the Start Menu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it is possible to use Notepad for creating HTML pages I do not recommend it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notepad has some issues displaying the HTML formatting correctly and it will ultimately just make it slower to learn.

                        I will not be recommending it as I have no experience with it, and it may not be able to do everything you need.
