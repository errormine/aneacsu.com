Recently, I joined the 1MB club on GitHub.

For those who aren't familiar, the 1MB club is a community of developers who have committed to keeping their website under 1 megabyte in size. This might not seem like a big deal, but in a world where website bloat is a major problem, it's a significant accomplishment.

So why is it important to me to keep my website small and minimal? For starters, smaller websites load faster, which can improve the user experience for visitors. In today's world of instant gratification, people don't want to wait around for a slow-loading website to load. By keeping my website under 1MB, I can ensure that it loads quickly and efficiently, even on slow connections.

In addition to the performance benefits, keeping my website small and minimal also forces me to focus on what's really important. When you're limited in terms of file size, you have to be selective about what you include on your website. This means I have to carefully consider what content and features are most important to me, and leave out anything that's not essential.

Of course, joining the 1MB club is just the beginning. There's always more work to be done to optimize my website and make it as fast and efficient as possible. But I'm proud of this accomplishment, and I hope it inspires others to think more critically about website bloat and the importance of keeping things small and minimal.
