title: "I'm Bricking My Smartphone"
---

As we increasingly rely on technology for various aspects of our lives, social media apps have become a ubiquitous part of daily routine for millions of people worldwide. With just a few taps on our smartphones, we have access to a vast array of content from around the world, including news, entertainment, and social connections. However, the constant bombardment of information through these apps can have negative effects on our health and well-being.

Social media apps have become notorious for their addictive nature, making it difficult for users to put down their phones and focus on other aspects of their lives. This can result in decreased productivity, increased stress levels, and a greater sense of loneliness and isolation, as users prioritize virtual connections over real-world relationships. Furthermore, the algorithmic nature of these apps often means that users are exposed only to content that reinforces their existing beliefs and biases, leading to polarization and a lack of critical thinking.

Research has linked excessive social media use to a range of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The constant comparison to other people's highlight reels can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a sense of being left behind. Furthermore, the blue light emitted from smartphone screens can disrupt our sleep patterns, leading to a range of physical health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

In recognition of these issues, I recently made the decision to switch from my smartphone to a basic brick phone. Although it may seem like a drastic move, I realized that the constant access to social media and other online distractions was taking a toll on my mental and physical health. By removing the temptation of these apps, I have been able to focus more on the present moment and connect more meaningfully with the people and world around me.

So, after the screen on my Google Pixel finally exploded and started leaking purple goo, I've decided it's the perfect time to take the plunge. It had been at the back of my mind for a while, but this was the final point which pushed me to go for it.

After looking around at a few different options I ultimately, decided to get a Nokia 225. It's nothing special, but that's kind of the whole point. The more annoying it is to use the less I will use it. It's also fairly cheap &mdash; I found one for $40 &mdash; which I feel is not too much of a commitment or waste of money on something that I may end up deciding isn't for me.

Of course, switching to a basic phone has come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to staying connected with friends and family. However, I believe that the benefits of this decision will be far outweighed the drawbacks. By prioritizing my mental and physical health, I hope to live a more balanced and fulfilling life, free from the constant distractions of excessive media consumption.
