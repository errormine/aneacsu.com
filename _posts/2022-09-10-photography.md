title: "Website Redesign"

Recently, I decided it was time for a redesign, and I'm excited to share the changes I've made. First and foremost, I've switched over to Jekyll for my blog posts. Jekyll is a static site generator that makes it easy to create and manage a blog, without the need for a CMS or database. This means my blog is now faster, more secure, and easier to maintain.

In addition to the blog redesign, I've also added a new [photography page](/photos) to showcase my images. As a photographer, it's important for me to have a dedicated space where I can display my work and connect with potential clients. On this page, visitors can view a selection of my favorite photos, organized by category and featuring captions that provide context and insight into the images.

One of the challenges of designing a photography page is finding the right balance between aesthetics and functionality. I wanted to create a visually striking layout that would highlight my images, while also making it easy for visitors to navigate and find what they're looking for. I used a minimalist design, with a simple navigation menu that allows visitors to filter images by category or search for specific keywords.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the redesign of my website. With the new Jekyll-powered blog and photography page, I now have a more professional and cohesive online presence. And as someone who is passionate about web development and photography, I'm excited to continue refining and improving my website as I grow and evolve as a creator.
