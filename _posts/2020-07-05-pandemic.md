title: Graduating During the Global Coronavirus Pandemic
---

Graduating high school is a milestone that many teenagers look forward to for years. It is a time when we celebrate the end of one chapter and look forward to the beginning of another. However, for many of us who graduated during the pandemic, this milestone was bittersweet, to say the least. The experience was harrowing, and we were left without many friends or much idea of what to do. I originally wanted to avoid writing about this, but as it's been a few months I feel it might be helpful to write about how I've been feeling.

The pandemic disrupted our lives in ways that we could never have imagined. Suddenly, we were forced to stay at home, attend classes virtually, and miss out on important events like prom and graduation. The pandemic not only impacted our physical health but also took a toll on our mental health. Many young people have been left feeling isolated, disconnected, and unsure of what the future will hold.

For those of us who graduated high school during the pandemic, the experience was particularly challenging. We missed out on the opportunity to celebrate our accomplishments with our peers, to say goodbye to teachers who had impacted our lives, and to receive the recognition we deserved for our hard work. Instead, we were left with virtual ceremonies, Zoom calls, and socially distanced celebrations, which were poor substitutes for the real thing.

Despite these challenges, graduating high school during the pandemic has taught us resilience and adaptability, qualities that will serve us well in the years to come. We have learned to be creative, to think outside the box, and to find new ways to connect with others. We have also learned to appreciate the small things in life, the moments of joy and happiness that can be found even in the darkest of times.

Moving forward, it is important for us to stay connected with others, to seek out new friendships and opportunities, and to never give up on our dreams. The pandemic may have disrupted our plans, but it cannot take away our hope, our resilience, or our determination. With hard work, perseverance, and a little bit of luck, we will emerge from this experience stronger and more prepared than ever before.

With determination and hard work, we can overcome any obstacle and create the future that we deserve.
