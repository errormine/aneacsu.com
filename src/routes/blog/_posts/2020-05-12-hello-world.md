I recently spent some time putting together this new website for personal use. While I wanted to keep things simple, I also wanted to include a blog system to share my thoughts and experiences with others. It's currently using PHP (which I kinda hate but idk what else there is) and some janky code I found on GitHub for the posts.

It's finished now and a piece of crap! Oh well, it works and I've learned quite a bit while messing around with it. I also created a guestbook which you can check out and sign it if you'd like. There are certainly areas where I could improve it. However, I'm proud of the work that I put into it and the results that I was able to achieve. By keeping it simple I was able to create my first blog page that I'm excited to continue building on in the future.

The website is self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi. To set it up, I used a little kit that I purchased from Microcenter. The kit included everything I needed to get started, including the Raspberry Pi itself, a case, a power supply, and even a microSD card for storing the website files. Once the Raspberry Pi was assembled, I simply transferred my website files over to the microSD card and set up an Nginx server on the Pi to host the website.

The process was surprisingly easy and straightforward, and I was amazed at how quickly I was able to get the website up and running. I love the idea of self-hosting my website on a small, affordable computer as it gives me complete control over my website and it doesn't cost a fortune. It's a cool and unique approach to website hosting that I'm very happy with. If you're interested in learning more about self-hosting your website on a Raspberry Pi, there are plenty of resources online to help you get started!

Anyway, thank you for reading. I hope to keep up with this website and learn much more as I go along.
