I was recently working on a project for my senior capstone course that required Google OAuth to function. Our group was using SvelteKit for the front-end and after trying a few different solutions we landed on lucia since it was the easiest to connect to our database.

In this article I'll be documenting how we got it working and how you can implement it in your own project.
