title: Fun with low poly modeling
description: "Some of my experience working with Blender."
---

I want to share my experience with learning Blender to create PSX style low poly 3D models for video games. Firstly, I must say that learning Blender has been a lot of fun. It has been fascinating to see how a basic geometric shape can transform into a complex 3D model with the right set of tools and techniques. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There have been a few challenges along the way.

One of the main challenges that I have encountered is texture painting. Creating good texture maps can be a difficult and time-consuming process. It takes a lot of patience and skill to create a texture that looks good on a low poly model. I have spent hours trying to get good results and utterly failing to make anything decent looking.

Even with basic geometry, it can be tough to get the results you want. Creating a low-poly model that looks good and performs well can be a real challenge. You need to think carefully about the shape of the model, where to place the vertices, and how it will interact with the game environment.

Despite these challenges, I've found that learning Blender has been a lot of fun. I've enjoyed experimenting with different tools and techniques to create 3D models, and I've learned a lot about the process of 3D modeling and how it's used in the video game industry.

I would like to keep learning and improving my skills in Blender. I have always dreamed of creating my own video game, and I think Blender will be an essential tool for achieving that goal. Below I have added some of the models and renders I've created so far.
