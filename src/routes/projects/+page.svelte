            <strong class="float-right">2023</strong><a href="https://errormine.itch.io/lunar-lander">Lunar Lander</a>

        <li>
            <strong class="float-right">2023</strong><a href="https://errormine.itch.io/creoterra">Creoterra</a>
            <p>Bring life to an empty planet. Very basic sandbox game which grows as you play it. This was created for the first ever Experimental Game Jam "Grid". I wanted to make something very simple that would develop around your actions. It's a bit unfinished since I ran out of time, but I'm hoping to keep learning and make more!</p>

            <strong class="float-right">2023</strong><a href="https://errormine.itch.io/boing">Boing!</a>
            <p>Jump on a trampoline for as long as you can. This is a crappy clone of the WarioWare mini-game of the same name. It's the first thing I created using Godot 3.5, and I think it's pretty cute.</p>

            <p>A really terrible Discord bot written with Java which I made in high school. It is mildly embarassing.</p>
