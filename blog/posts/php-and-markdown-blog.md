# 09/27/2021 Creating a Blog With PHP and Markdown

<div class="content" markdown="1">

After several failed attempts of adding a simple blog to my website I've finally found something that works as I would like, so I might as well write about it as my first post.

Originally, I wrote everything myself and I had to write each page with HTML by hand and it just took absolutely forever, it didn't look very good, and it was just too much work to change things around.

Then I came across [this blog](https://blog.azuki.vip/) which I noticed was using markdown for each blog post, and I became curious about how I could do something like that.

I looked into this thing called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that seemed promising at first. Unfortunately, I've never used Ruby or anything like that so it was fairly confusing to me, however, I noticed they let you make a clone of their Github repo and then customize it to your liking. As well as Github Pages functionality which seemed perfect since I wouldn't even have to host anything on my own server.

I managed to get it up and running, but it was using some premade theme that didn't fit with the rest of my website, and I didn't feel like editing it all to match my other pages.

Since I wasn't getting any results that I liked, I gave up on trying for a while. That is until I stumbled upon this incredible little Github repo [Cristy94/markdown-blog](https://github.com/Cristy94/markdown-blog) which renders markdown blog posts using PHP.

I modified the source code slightly to fit my website, and now I believe that I've got quite the cute and minimalist little blog set up here!

I will probably add a couple more features that I would like to have for a little more ease of use, but for now it works pretty great and I defintely recommend taking a look at this solution if you would like a really simple static blog and you've already got a web server.

Anyway thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!
