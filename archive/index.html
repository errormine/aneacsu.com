            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>My journey with Godot has been slow, but I continue to learn more things all the time. I keep starting projects that go nowhere, but as I make more I will continue to share it.</p>

                    <p>A small puzzle game inspired by the short story by Jorge Luis Borges. Explore the halls of the Universe and solve puzzles that lead to ???</p>

                    <p>A very simple game made in a few days where you have to land a space craft on the moon.</p>

                    <p>Bring life to an empty planet. Very basic sandbox game which grows as you play it. This was created for the first ever Experimental Game Jam "Grid". I wanted to make something very simple that would develop around your actions. It's a bit unfinished since I ran out of time, but I'm hoping to keep learning and make more!</p>

                    <p>Jump on a trampoline for as long as you can. This is a crappy clone of the WarioWare mini-game of the same name. It's the first thing I created using Godot 3.5, and I think it's pretty cute.</p>
